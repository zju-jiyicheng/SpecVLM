## About
[EMNLP 2025 Main] SPECVLM: Enhancing Speculative Decoding of Video LLMs via Verifier-Guided Token Pruning

üîó [arXiv 2508.16201](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2508.16201)


## üìñ Abstract
Video large language models (Vid-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in understanding video content. However, their reliance on dense video token representations introduces substantial memory and computational overhead in both prefilling and decoding. To mitigate the information loss of recent video token reduction methods and accelerate the decoding stage of Vid-LLMs losslessly, we introduce SPECVLM, a training-free speculative decoding (SD) framework tailored for Vid-LLMs that incorporates staged video token pruning. Building on our novel finding that the draft model‚Äôs speculation exhibits low sensitivity to video token pruning, SPECVLM prunes up to 90% of video tokens to enable efficient speculation without sacrificing accuracy. To achieve this, we perform a two-stage pruning process: Stage I selects highly informative tokens guided by attention signals from the verifier (target model), while Stage II prunes the remaining redundant ones in a spatially uniform manner. Extensive experiments on four video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SPECVLM, which achieves up to 2.68√ó decoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11√ó speedup for Qwen2.5-VL-32B.

- For LLaVA-OneVision models: https://huggingface.co/llava-hf
- For Qwen2.5-VL models: https://huggingface.co/Qwen 
- For VideoDetailCaption dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmms-lab/VideoDetailCaption


## üöÄ Quick Evaluation
Run the demo script to quickly evaluate SPECVLM:
```bash
sh run.sh
```
Please also moderate the model path, data path, pruning ratio, and frame number in run.sh file.

After runing the script, the evaluation result will be stored in results/.

## Note
- Our method primarily targets resource-constrained long-video scenarios, where GPU memory bandwidth constitutes the main bottleneck during inference. Users are advised to set the input length according to GPU capacity. 
- In principle, our approach is lossless, with only minimal impact introduced by the attention implementation and data type settings.
